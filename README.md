## Vision: Why the Bitcoin Standard?

The Bitcoin Standard is more than just holding Bitcoin on your balance sheet. It’s a commitment to building a company that aligns with the principles of **freedom, transparency, and censorship-resistance**.

By adopting the Bitcoin Standard, your company becomes part of this movement, signaling to employees, customers, and the world that you believe in:

1. **Self-Sovereignty**: Rejecting the old system of endless money printing and arbitrary rules.
2. **Value Creation**: Building something that lasts, rather than chasing short-term valuations.
3. **Integrity and Transparency**: Operating with the same openness and verifiability as Bitcoin’s blockchain.

This playbook is your roadmap to living these principles in practice.

## Treasury Management: Holding Bitcoin

### Why Hold Bitcoin on Your Balance Sheet?

Bitcoin serves as a long-term store of value, protecting your company against inflation and fiat devaluation. It’s also a strategic reserve that can appreciate over time.

### How to Start: Allocating a Percentage of Treasury

Begin by allocating a small percentage (e.g., 1-5%) of your treasury to Bitcoin. Gradually increase this allocation as your confidence grows.

### Custody Solutions: Hot Wallets, Cold Storage, and Multisig

- **Hot Wallets**: For small, operational amounts (e.g., [Blockstream Green](https://blockstream.com/green/)).
- **Cold Storage**: For long-term holdings (e.g., [Trezor](https://trezor.io), [Ledger](https://ledger.com)).
- **Multisig**: For enhanced security (e.g., [Casa](https://keys.casa), [Unchained Capital](https://unchained.com)).
